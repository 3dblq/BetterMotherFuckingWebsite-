        <h1>This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</h1>
    <header>
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
<h1>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h1>
    <h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn <a href="https://www.thehackingproject.org/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li><i>still</i>  fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li><i>still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i>  accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's <i>still</i>  legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker</h3>

<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>

<p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your ***** Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of cake.</p>

    <h2>It's responsive</h2>
    <h2>It fucking works</h2>
<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
    <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no **** idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are ***** skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a ***** message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's really beautiful. <br>

If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.<p>


    <h3>A little less contrast</h3>
<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>



<h3>Size Matters</h3>

<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>
   
<h3>Line-width, motherfucker</h3>
<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

<h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
		<p>I love what the creator of <a href="https://www.thehackingproject.org/"> this site's inspiration did</a>. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
